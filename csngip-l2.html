                <p>India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: Australian skipper Mitchell Marsh won the toss and opted to bowl first against Rohit Sharma’s India in Super 8 game of the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet in St Lucia on Monday.

                    Australia similar to India looked like near perfect team until their shock defeat to Afghanistan which opened glaring holes in the side. However, given the quality and potential of the side, they can turn over any side on a given day. Star all-rounder Glenn Maxwell’s form has been up for debate and if there is a day to show his utility it is today.

                 <p>Weeks after the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) recorded its worst-ever Lok Sabha performance, party supremo Mayawati on Sunday reinstated her nephew Akash Anand as her sole political heir and the party’s national coordinator while urging leaders to “give him more respect than earlier”. <br>Mayawati appointed Akash as the party’s national coordinator in 2019 and in December last year named him her political successor only to sack him last month. While BSP leaders said they were sure Anand would be reinstated, they did not expect the decision to come so soon. Some in the party speculated that Mayawati’s quick U-turn was the result of the emergence of Nagina MP Chandrashekhar Aazad as a powerful alternative in the Bahujan movement. <br></p>

            <h3><br>Newsmaker | Who is Mahant Raju Das, the Ayodhya priest who argued with District Magistrate over BJP’s poll defeat?<br><br></h3>
            <p>A priest of Ayodhya’s Hanuman Garhi Temple, Mahant Raju Das, has often been in the news for his statements on religious matters and political incidents that tend to spark rows. This time, it is over an argument with Ayodhya’s District Magistrate Nitish Kumar on Friday night. <br>A police security gunner provided to Das was withdrawn on Saturday after his argument with Kumar over the BJP’s electoral defeat in the Faizabad parliamentary constituency of which the temple town is a part. The priest showed up at a review meeting called by UP Cabinet ministers Surya Pratap Shahi and Jaiveer Singh and blamed the district administration’s recent actions for the BJP’s defeat. <br>Mahant Das said he met UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday to discuss the row. “I met the CM and briefed him about what happened on Friday. I have all faith in Yogi Adityanath and his justice,”<br>Asked about the controversies he often finds himself in, Mahant Das said, “I do not only make statements but mean them as well. I am a warrior of Sanatan Dharma and Hinduism and have the responsibility to protect it as well. If someone attacks our religion I won’t keep silent and will certainly retaliate … Like, Swami Prasad Maurya’s objectionable comments on Ramcharitmanas. After the holy book was torn and burnt, I retaliated and made my stand clear.”<br> </p>

                    <br>India on the other hand like the 2023 World Cup looking unbeatable. However, apart from Afghanistan, they are yet to face a high-quality side who are also in good form and Australia would also be good preparation for what might await them in the semifinals. With the team in winning momentum, Rohit Sharma might refrain from making any changes to the side.

                    <br>Teams:
                    
                    <br>India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah

                    <h3>India squad for Zimbabwe series announced: Shubman Gill named captain, SRH’s Abhishek Sharma and RR’s Riyan Parag among debutants</h3>
                    <p><br><br>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday officially announced the squad for the upcoming Zimbabwe series, scheduled to begin from July 6.

                        <br>As earlier reported by the Indian Express, Shubman Gill will be captaining the side with most of the names taking part in the ongoing T20 World Cup sitting this series out that includes Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav.
                        
                        <br>In-form Sunrisers Hyderabad opener Abhishek Sharma and Riyan Parag, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Tushar Deshpande, Khaleel Ahmed all regulars for their respective teams in the IPL will board the flight to Zimbabwe and so will those on the bench during the T20 World Cup, Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh.Gill, who travelled to the Indian team to USA as a reserve player, returned to India along with pacer Avesh Khan as the team management wanted to give them a break as they were unlikely to feature in any of the T20 World Cup games. <br>

                        <br>It is the first time Abhishek Sharma, 23, was selected for an Indian team. The Punjab batsman had scored 484 runs and along with Travis Head, gave SRH flying starts in the IPL. Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag too had a great IPL season tallying 573 runs. The selectors wanted to test out another medium-pace allround and hence picked SRH’s Reddy. Reddy had won BCCI’s emerging player of the year award. Mumbai’s pacer Deshpande, had a good domestic season, was a dependable bowler for Chennai Super Kings. <br></p>

The party saw Sonakshi’s parents, Shatrughan Sinha and Poonam Sinha, also in attendance. <br>Shatrughan’s presence at the party dismissed all the rumours that he was not happy with the union and was unlikely to not even attend the marriage ceremony. The gossip took steam when Shatrughan told Times Now that he was “waiting to be informed” about his daughter’s wedding and added, “All I can say is, aaj kal ke bachche consent nahin lete maa-baap ke, sirf inform karte hain (Nowadays, children don’t seek permission; they simply inform their parents).”</p>

That too is a huge validation for my work.” <br> </p>
